Project
My idea is a new food delivery service that can go to multiple supermarkets to pick up the specific items you need. This means that if you needed different things from different shops then someone can go to all these different shops for you instead of having to go yourself. It would work like other food delivery services, where someone will recive your order and collect them from shops for you.
